"""
Defines the abstract base class tkApp, from which concrete tkinter applications can be derived.

Concrete implementation child classes must:
    (1) Implement the factory method _createViewManager() to create and return a tkViewManager instance,
        which will create and manage the widgets of the application.
    (2) Implement _createModel() factory method to create and return a Model instance, which 
        holds the data and business logic of the application.
Concrete implementation child classes likely will:
    (3) Pass AboutAppInfo named tuple into super.__init__() to set up the app's About dialog.
    (4) Pass menu_dict into super.__init__() to set up the app's menubar.
    (5) Pass file_types into super.__init__() to set up the file types for file dialogs.
    (6) Define and implement handler functions for menubar selections, beyond OnFileOpen, OnFileSave,
        OnFileSaveAs, OnFileExit, OnViewHelp, and OnHelpAbout.
Concrete implementation child classes may:
    (7) Extend _setup_child_widgets() if the tkViewManager does not create all of the app's widgets
    (8) Extend logging setup in _setup_logging(...) if application specific logging is desired.

Exported Classes:
    tkApp -- Interface (abstract base) class for tkinter applications. tkApp is a ttk.Frame.

Exported Exceptions:
    None    
 
Exported Functions:
    None

Logging:
    A logger named 'tkApp_logger' is created and configured in _setup_logging(...), which is called by __init__(...).
    It logs to stderr through a stream handler. Default logging level is logging.INFO, but can be set by passing
    log_level into __init__(...). The 'tkApp_logger' logger can be used by concrete implementation child classes of tkApp.
