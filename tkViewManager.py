"""
Defines the abstract base class tkViewManager. Concrete child implementations create widgets for tkApp concreate child implementations
and handle the interactions between widgets.

Class follows the mediator design pattern and acts as Observer. tkViewManager is a ttk.Frame.

Concrete implementation child classes must:
    (1) Implement the method _CreateWidgets(), which is called by __init__ to create and set up the child widgets
        of the tkViewManager widget.
    (2) Implement the handler function handle_model_update() to handle updates from the model.
    (3) Define and implement handler functions for widget updates, e.g., def handle_x_widget_update(self).
        Note:
            (a) Handler functions are registered with the tkViewManager via register_subject(...), typically
                after each widget is created in _CreateWidgets. 
            (b) Handler functions are automatically called from the update(...) method when a subject (child widget)
                notifies the tkViewManager by calling notify() on itself.
